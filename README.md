##Inspiration
We were inspired by the need for secure and convenient banking solutions in today's digital age. Our aim was to create a system that provides users with temporary bank credentials for safer online transactions.

##What it does
The project securely authenticates users and generates temporary bank credentials, including card numbers and CVV codes, which expire in 5 minutes. It incorporates encryption, usage limits, and fraud detection for enhanced security. Users receive notifications for transactions and credential expiration.

##How we built it
We built the project using a combination of front-end and back-end technologies. The front-end was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the back-end utilized server-side scripting languages like PHP or Python. We employed secure authentication methods and implemented encryption algorithms for data protection.

##Challenges we ran into
One challenge we faced was ensuring the security of the generated credentials and preventing unauthorized access. Additionally, implementing robust fraud detection algorithms and handling transaction notifications posed technical hurdles.

##Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud to have created a secure and user-friendly solution for temporary banking credentials. Overcoming technical challenges and successfully implementing encryption and fraud detection features were significant accomplishments for our team.

##What we learned
Through this project, we gained valuable insights into banking security protocols, encryption techniques, and fraud prevention strategies. We also honed our skills in web development, server-side scripting, and project management.

##What's next for CtrlAltEsc
In the future, we plan to further enhance the security and functionality of CtrlAltEsc. This may include refining fraud detection algorithms, integrating additional authentication methods, and expanding the range of supported banking services. We also aim to collaborate with financial institutions to ensure compliance with industry standards and regulations.
